    date: 'November 2025',
    doi: '10.13140/RG.2.2.35952.52483',
    abstract: 'Feeding a rapidly growing population sustainably requires boosting agricultural productivity through nutrient-mobilizing bacteria that reduce chemical fertilizer dependence. Maize (Zea mays) is a highly versatile crop grown globally, which demands high nitrogen and phosphate. This study isolated and characterized thirteen rhizospheric and endophytic bacteria from maize plants grown in Bangladesh. Four select isolates showed outstanding in vitro plant growth-promoting screening assays. In vivo trials highlighted significant improvements in germination indices, vigor index, root/shoot weight, carotenoid content, and Deficit / ROS scavenging activity, showing major potential for eco-friendly sustainable agriculture.',

    conference: 'International Biotechnology Conference 2025 at BRAC University, Dhaka, Bangladesh',
    date: 'June 2025',
    abstract: 'Soil pollution caused by heavy metals is a major problem in industrial zones of Bangladesh like Savar and Dhaka. The main goal of this study is to isolate and characterize heavy metal-resistant PGPRs from the rhizosphere of vegetable plants in Savar irrigated by tannery wastewater. Nine bacteria were isolated and screened for plant growth-promoting (PGP) traits including nitrogen fixation, phosphate and zinc solubilization, ammonia production, IAA synthesis, and siderophore production. Isolates Iso-6 and Iso-8 showed excellent heavy metal removal efficiency against Cd, Mn, and Pb under salinity stress. Controlled pot experiments on rice demonstrated that inoculation with these bacterial strains meaningfully increased plant height, germination, vigor, and chlorophyll content compared to uninoculated controls.',

    date: 'May 2025',
    abstract: 'The human eye is a major sensory organ susceptible to many infectious agents, such as bacteria including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and many more. These bacteria contaminate eyeglasses and can be transmitted into the eyes, resulting in conjunctivitis, keratitis, corneal ulcers, endophthalmitis, and dacryocystitis. The goals of this study were to study the eyeglass cleaning behaviors of users and the prevalence of ocular pathogens on eyeglasses. In total, eleven bacterial isolates were selected using Mannitol Salt Agar and Eosin Methyl Blue Agar media and characterized using morphological and biochemical tests. Survey findings revealed that a significant number of individuals were unfamiliar about the presence of germs on glasses. Investigation of cleaning efficacy showed alcohol-based wipes have the best prevention against pathogens. In antibiogram studies, the majority of isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and kanamycin, but resistant to azithromycin.',

    abstract: 'This study investigates raw poultry chicken meat (broiler, sonali, and layer) from Rajshahi markets, revealing the presence of potentially pathogenic and multidrug-resistant bacteria including Klebsiella, Salmonella, Shigella, Staphylococcus, and Escherichia coli. Using a combination of morphological, biochemical, and antibiotic sensitivity tests, the study demonstrates serious public health concerns related to foodborne illnesses and antimicrobial resistance. Despite widespread resistance, a few antibiotics—namely Imipenem, Ciprofloxacin, and Rifampicin—were found effective. These findings underscore the urgent need for safer food handling practices, public awareness, and responsible antibiotic use in Bangladesh’s poultry industry.',
